JSON Schema to C parser generator
=================================

This is a proof of concept script to generate a C parser for a specific JSON Schema

Only a very small subset of JSON schema features are usable currently.

The JSON tokenizer used is [JSMN](https://github.com/zserge/jsmn). It works great.
